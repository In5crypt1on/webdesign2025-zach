Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.
These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.
These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. We wonâ€™t need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful.


<h3> MATH </h3>
++_____=immidet increase
_____++=increase after currnt task 
(*=)= multiply number by everything after equals
add a (+) before a Prompt to make the numbers add
== means equality test
< and > mean less than and Greater than
= means a assignment (ex: A= prompt(...);)
=== checks equality without type conversion

<h3> If, Else, ?, and other stuff </h3>
If (...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and if its true executes code
Else is if the If statement is falsy
? has a condition behind it and if true does value1 before the :, if not does value after the colon

<h3> Logical operators </h3>
<ul> The list of operators:
<li> AND ( && )
<li> OR ( || )
<li> NOT ( ! )
<li> Nullish Coalescing (??)
</ul>
OR: Shows first Truthy statement if all others are false, will only show false if all statement are false
AND: Opposite of OR, and is more powerful
NOT: Inverses Value (true becomes false, false becomes true)
Nullish Coalescing: shows first non Null value

undefined == null = true
undefined === null = false
null == "\n0\n" = false
null === +"\n0\n" = false
